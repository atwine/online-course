    "### What is Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning has the potential to provide data-driven clinical decision support (CDS) to physicians and hospital staff paving the way for an increased revenue potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning, a subset of AI designed to identify patterns, uses algorithms and data to give automated insights to healthcare providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of AI in Healthcare and Medicine\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Business Insider Intelligence reported that researchers at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center used IBM Watson's Genomic product to identify specific treatments for over 1,000 patients. The product performed big data analysis to determine treatment options for people with tumors who were showing genetic abnormalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Comparatively, Google's Cloud Healthcare application programming interface (API) includes CDS offerings and other AI solutions that help doctors make more informed clinical decisions regarding patients. AI used in Google Cloud takes data from users' electronic health records through machine learning creating insights for healthcare providers to make better clinical decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is AI used in healthcare?\n",
    "AI is still a relatively new technology, especially in the healthcare industry where adoption remains in its infancy. As AI and machine learning tools become more sophisticated, their use cases have expanded; however, adoption of AI remains low, according to John Frownfelter, chief medical information officer at Jvion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We're still in the hype phase where many organizations are trying to understand how it fits into an overall strategy,\" said Frownfelter. \"Early AI was seen … with more of an emphasis on pattern recognition for billing processes. It has evolved to a much more sophisticated use of deep machine learning and leveraging the power of big data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI applications include wide-ranging use cases, from cybersecurity to radiographic imaging, Frownfelter said. As AI applications continue to improve, the entire healthcare industry could undergo a shift. Here are some of the major ways AI is expected to shape healthcare in the coming years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnostics\n",
    "AI excels at categorizing data, especially once it has been exposed to large amounts of data on the subject. That creates great promise for AI when it comes to diagnostics – medical imaging analysis and patient medical records, genetics, and more can all be combined to improve diagnostic outcomes. Moreover, AI tools can use similar information to craft unique treatment approaches and offer recommendations to doctors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"The really interesting developments are in the clinical arena,\" said Frownfelter. \"Clinical prescriptive analytics is probably the closest AI is getting to support direct patient care in 2019.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robot-assisted surgery\n",
    "\n",
    "Robotic surgeries allow surgeons to use smaller tools and make more precise incisions. Surgeons (and patients) could also benefit from AI by combining medical records with real-time data during operations, as well as drawing on data from previous successful surgeries of the same type. Accenture, a technology consulting firm, estimates that AI-enabled, robot-assisted surgery could save the U.S. healthcare industry $40 billion annually by 2026.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='hlt2.jpg'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual nursing assistants\n",
    "Think of virtual nursing assistants like an Alexa for your hospital bedside. These virtual assistants replicate the typical behavior of a nurse by assisting patients with their daily routines, reminding them to take medications or go to appointments, helping answer medical questions and more. __Accenture estimates that virtual nursing assistants could be the second-largest source of annual savings for the U.S. healthcare industry, cutting as much as $20 billion in costs.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Administrative workflow assistance\n",
    "Naturally, medical practices, hospitals and other points of care result in a great deal of paperwork. In fact, it was consolidating and digitizing these records that led to the industry-wide adoption of electronic health records systems. AI has already started to make its way into these systems and can be used to streamline administrative functions as well. Accenture estimates that new efficiencies in administrative workflow due to emerging AI technologies could result in $18 billion in annual savings.\n",
